// Assignment: Ninja Class II
// Complete the below challenges using Ninja from the previous assignment.
// .punch() - Add a new method to Ninja called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in.
// .kick() - Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
// Validations - Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of Ninja. Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.

// var blueNinja = new Ninja("Goemon");
// var redNinja = new Ninja("Bill Gates");
// redNinja.punch(blueNinja);
// // -> "Goemon was punched by Bill Gates and lost 5 Health!"

// blueNinja.kick(redNinja);
// // -> "Bill Gates was kicked by Goemon and lost 15 Health!"
// // In this case, redNinja Bill Gates lost 15 health because blueNinja Goemon has 1 point of strength
